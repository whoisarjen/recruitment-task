## Starting project

To run the project we have to get care of server's and client's site.

Inside "_server" we need to install all dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

then we can run server:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

Now we can move to "client" folder and basiclly do the same:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Client's site should be ready to start:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

After everything React should open browser with "localhost:3000". Server uses "localhost:1337".
